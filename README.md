Happiness Index Calculator

Overview:
The Happiness Index Calculator is a Python program that calculates a "Happiness Index" based on several lifestyle factors. It helps users evaluate their overall happiness by taking inputs on sleep, exercise, work-life balance, and personal satisfaction. The result is a score that indicates their happiness level and displays a visual representation (smiley or sad face) based on the score.

Purpose:
This project is designed to help individuals reflect on their daily habits and lifestyle choices that impact their happiness. By assessing key factors such as sleep and exercise, users can gain insights into how balanced their lifestyle is and identify areas for improvement.

How It Works:
The Happiness Index is calculated using a weighted average of the following factors:

Sleep Hours: Ideal is 7-9 hours per day.
Exercise Hours: Ideal is 1 hour per day.
Work-Life Balance: Rated on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being excellent balance.
Personal Satisfaction: Rated on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being fully satisfied.
The formula for the Happiness Index is:

python
Copy code
happiness_index = (sleep_score * 0.3 + exercise_score * 0.2 + 
                   balance_score * 0.3 + satisfaction_score * 0.2) * 10
The result is categorized into three levels:

You're happy! (Score: 75-100)
:) You're doing okay! (Score: 50-74)
:( You may want to work on some areas of your life. (Score below 50)
Installation
To use the Happiness Index Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. 

The following details might be asked in the code to calculate your "happiness":

Sleep Hours: The number of hours you sleep per day.
Exercise Hours: The number of hours you exercise per day.
Work-Life Balance: Rate your work-life balance on a scale of 1-10.
Personal Satisfaction: Rate your personal satisfaction on a scale of 1-10.
The program will calculate your Happiness Index and display a corresponding smiley or sad face based on your score.

Example:
Enter how many hours you sleep per day: 7
Enter how many hours you exercise per day: 1
Rate your work-life balance on a scale of 1-10: 8
Rate your personal satisfaction on a scale of 1-10: 9

:D You're happy! Happiness Index: 87.5
